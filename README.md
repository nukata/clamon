# Clamon

Clamon is a real-time virus scanner for macOS 10.11-10.13.
It monitors the directories you specified and scans every newly created
or modified files there with `clamd` of ClamAV.
It is implemented with Python 2.7.10 that is built in macOS (`/usr/bin/python`).

## Prerequisites

- ClamAV 0.99.4 or above.
  You can install it either with Homebrew or MacPorts, or from the source.

## How to use

1. Set up `clamd.conf` in ClamAV.
```console
/usr/local/etc/clamav$ diff clamd.conf.sample clamd.conf
8c8
< Example
---
> #Example
85c85
< #LocalSocket /tmp/clamd.socket
---
> LocalSocket /tmp/clamd.socket
93c93
< #LocalSocketMode 660
---
> LocalSocketMode 660
```

2. Run `clamd`.
```console
~$ /usr/local/sbin/clamd
```

3. Run `clamon.py` with directories you want to montor.
   If you run it without directories, it will monitor the current directory.
   Whenever a virus file comes to occur under any level of subdirectory of
   monitored directores, its path name and virus name will be `print`ed.
   You can stop `clamon.py` at any time by hitting the return key.
```console
~$ chmod a+x /path/to/clamon.py
~$ /path/to/clamon.py
Monitoring (
    "/Users/suzuki"
)
Hit Return to stop me: 
```
